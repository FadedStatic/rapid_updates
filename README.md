This is a project which makes use of [my project](https://github.com/FadedStatic/patternscanner).

## Purpose
This project used to be for dumping Lua functions in a game engine which used such functions and often moved them around, this is a prime example of a use case for my pattern scanner.
You can use signature scanning as well as string & function xref scanning to essentially "map out" a binary, which aids in the reverse engineering of binaries that frequently change.
